## About The Project

**The Inner Circle** is a Node.js web application that simulates an exclusive, members-only message board. It's built to demonstrate core concepts of web development, including authentication, session management, database integration, and role-based access control.

New users can sign up, but they have limited access. Only by providing a secret code can they become a "member," unlocking the ability to see who authored messages and when they were posted, as well as create their own posts. A special "admin" status grants the power to moderate the board by deleting messages.

### Key Features

- **üîê Secure User Authentication**: Robust login and registration system using Passport.js.
- **üé≠ Role-Based Access**: Three user levels: Non-Member, Member, and Admin.
- **ü§´ Exclusive Content**: Message authors and timestamps are hidden from non-members.
- **‚úçÔ∏è Message Board**: Members can create and view detailed messages.
- **üëë Admin Powers**: Admins can delete any message to keep the peace.
- **‚ú® Flash Notifications**: Users receive contextual feedback for their actions.
- **üß© Riddle Game**: A fun riddle to help non-members discover the secret code.

## üèÅ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm
- A running PostgreSQL instance

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repo**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your_username/the-inner-circle.git
    ```
2.  **Install NPM packages**
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Set up your environment variables**
    Rename `.env.example` to `.env`. The most important variable is `DATABASE_URL`, which tells Prisma how to connect to your local PostgreSQL database. Update it with your credentials. You'll also need to set `MEMBER_SECRET_CODE` and `ADMIN_SECRET_CODE`.

4.  **Set up the database with Prisma**
    Instead of running SQL manually, you'll use Prisma Migrate. This command reads your `prisma/schema.prisma` file and automatically creates the necessary tables in your database.

    ```sh
    npx prisma migrate dev --name init
    ```

5.  **Run the application**
    ```sh
    npm start
    ```
    The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## üéÆ How to Become a Member

Don't have the secret code? No problem! Visit the "Become a Member" page and click the "Solve the Riddle" button. A short, fun game will give you the code you need to unlock full membership.

---

## üö¢ Deployment

This application is designed for easy deployment on platforms like Render.

1.  **Connect your Git repository** to Render.
2.  **Create a new "Web Service"** and point it to your repository.
3.  **Set the Build Command** to `npm install && npx prisma generate`. The `prisma generate` step is crucial to ensure the Prisma Client is created in the production environment.
4.  **Set the Start Command** to `npm start`.
5.  **Add your environment variables** (`DATABASE_URL`, `SESSION_SECRET`, etc.) in the Render dashboard.

Render will automatically deploy your application whenever you push changes to your main branch.
