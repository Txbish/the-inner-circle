## About The Project

**The Inner Circle** is a Node.js web application that simulates an exclusive, members-only message board. It's built to demonstrate core concepts of web development, including authentication, session management, database integration, and role-based access control.

New users can sign up, but they have limited access. Only by providing a secret code can they become a "member," unlocking the ability to see who authored messages and when they were posted, as well as create their own posts. A special "admin" status grants the power to moderate the board by deleting messages.

### Key Features

- **üîê Secure User Authentication**: Robust login and registration system using Passport.js.
- **üé≠ Role-Based Access**: Three user levels: Non-Member, Member, and Admin.
- **ü§´ Exclusive Content**: Message authors and timestamps are hidden from non-members.
- **‚úçÔ∏è Message Board**: Members can create and view detailed messages.
- **üëë Admin Powers**: Admins can delete any message to keep the peace.
- **‚ú® Flash Notifications**: Users receive contextual feedback for their actions.
